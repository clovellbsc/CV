## Work Experience

**Metropolitan Police Service** (September 2019 to January 2022)  
_Police Constable_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.
- Worked as a Police Constable in the largest Police Service in the UK. I was based on the Emergency Response Policing Team in the London Borough of Islington, where I worked within a core team of approximately 30 officers. During this time I was put into high pressured situations and had to adapt to them quickly, accurately and as part of a team.
I had to work in an agile and dynamic way due to unknown variables that I had to deal with, from suspects, to victims, to on-lookers. Any situation could change in the blink of an eye and I would have to assess the full scope of the issue and adapt to the small changes in a way that still successfully managed to fulfil the appropriate outcome.

**Company Name** (July 2017 to August 2019)  
_Assistant Ecologist_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

- eye for detail (necessary to ensure that all evidence was identified at an incident and to ensure all reports and casefiles were accurate to ensure they weren't thrown out at court due to an error) (Ecology: ability to identify the smallest of signs of a protected species and to ensure that all reports going to
- ability to learn quickly and on the fly - linked to research below
- ability to adapt
- long hours when needed
- calm under pressure - (police - all of it) (ecology - completing all work whilst under pressure from client to hit their deadlines)
- ability to problem solve - (police - ensuring use of dynamic risk assessment and adapt to changes)
- research unknown - police + ecology - didn't know all but had to learn how to find answer
- work independently or part of team - ecology + police
- leadership - police (leading new people) and ecology(ran teams of surveyors)
- ability to manage work and deadlines (ecology: writing reports to deadlines whilst managing survey work) (police: ensuring casefiles are prepared and managed to deadlines set by CPS)
- Constant learning (legislation constantly being created and updated and had to keep up to date to ensure I was aware of the scope of my powers and responsibilities)

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
