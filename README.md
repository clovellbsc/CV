## Chris Lovell
I’m an enthusiastic and dedicated software engineer who strives to learn new things daily. Throughout my varied career I’ve learnt to work under immense pressure and adapt to different situations. Along the way, I’ve been able to build great relationships and understand good collaboration within a team. I first developed my passion for coding when I downloaded an app on my phone to try it out and continued from there. I designed a very basic BMI calculator, which I showed off to everyone that would take a look. From there I decided I wanted to move forward with software engineering as my career and that's when I decided to join Makers, an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp. After achieving more than I could ever have dreamed of, I am now seeking a role where I can continue to develop my technical skills in a supportive and challenging environment.

### Travel Angel
Travel Angel was my final project whilst studying at Makers, we were given two weeks to complete a full life cycle development of an app. I worked alongside four other students in a collaborative and agile way, please check out the link above to see the github repository. This project was a full life cycle development of an application to aid with keeping track of all your travel documents. The idea behind Travel Angel was that when going on holiday there are so many bookings to keep track of with lots of different documents and these are generally spread over a number of emails and printed documents. Our team have had struggles with this exact issue when travelling and will carry a binder or loose documents when going away, so we thought we would try to solve this issue. [Please feel free to check out the repository.](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/travel-angel)

**Technologies Used**
- React
- MongoDB Atlas
- Nodejs
- Express
- Jest
- React testing library

**Main Features**
- Authentication created using Express Session, with passwords encrypted using BCrypt
- Travel Angel utilises a flight API to autofill flight details using the flight number and date for an easier user experience
- Storage of details for individual trips separately to improve user experience
- Uploading and Downloading documents, so that the user can have their documents stored exactly where they need them
- Fully encapsulating all aspects of travel eg visas, accommodation, flights
- All exceptions are caught and actioned

### Koala
Koala was a group project that I worked on within a 6 person team. This project was designed to create a social media app over a 2 week period. I worked alongside a really great team and a lot was learned. This app was developed using the MEHN stack and at the beginning of the project, we had only ever used Nodejs. A small seed project was given to us as a means of starting, this included a basic Express backend with express session middleware, a couple of basic user authentication routes, with no encryption, a MongoDB Schema and a very basic front-end HTML index page. Due to the lack of knowledge about the technologies, we had to understand the seed project and learn how to utilise these technologies all within our two week deadline.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.
-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

- eye for detail (necessary to ensure that all evidence was identified at an incident and to ensure all reports and casefiles were accurate to ensure they weren't thrown out at court due to an error) (Ecology: ability to identify the smallest of signs of a protected species and to ensure that all reports going to
- ability to learn quickly and on the fly - linked to research below
- ability to adapt
- long hours when needed
- calm under pressure - (police - all of it) (ecology - completing all work whilst under pressure from client to hit their deadlines)
- ability to problem solve - (police - ensuring use of dynamic risk assessment and adapt to changes)
- research unknown - police + ecology - didn't know all but had to learn how to find answer
- work independently or part of team - ecology + police
- leadership - police (leading new people) and ecology(ran teams of surveyors)
- ability to manage work and deadlines (ecology: writing reports to deadlines whilst managing survey work) (police: ensuring casefiles are prepared and managed to deadlines set by CPS)

#### Ability to learn quickly and continuation of learning. Teaching. Team Work. Need to add soft skills - public and client facing roles

- In both my previous careers I had to adapt and learn very quickly. 
- Whilst at EcoSupport Ltd, I was working on ecological field work from my first day and had to ensure that all legislation was followed completely otherwise our clients could end up breaking the law and have serious ramifications on their financial success.
- Within EcoSupport after just over a year, I was entrusted with making a training manual that could be used by all staff both present and future across all levels. Due to my approach to learning and excitement over it, I produced a document, which was used by not only new starters but also senior Ecologists at my company.
- Whilst in the Metropolitan Police Service I undertook an intensive training course and was working as a Constable interacting with the public within just a few months. If I hadn't ensured that I was learning effectively and quickly and identifying where I could gather my information from then it could have had a serious impact on the public and reflect badly on the Police Service as a whole.
- I took my ability to adapt and learn effectively and implemented it during my course at Makers. My team's final project was created with React for the front-end, which is not a technology that is taught at Makers. I took it upon myself to learn React for my final project. I succesffully learned the fundamentals of React and helped my teammates to understand the technology to the level that we could all feel comfortable utilising this brand new technology for pour final project.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Hobbies
- As you can see above, I am a PADI Divemaster and absolutley love diving. I haven't had the chance to dive in the last few years and am feeling the pull of the water.
- I used to play rugby 7 times a week when I was 18 and that passion has continued, although I am no longer playing, I absolutely loved watching England. Less so when they are losing, which is all too often nowadays.
- Travel. It has been too long since I have left the country but love exploring new places and experiencing new cultures.
